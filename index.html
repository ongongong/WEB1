    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web
        resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be
        accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He
        wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web
        owser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991
        to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
